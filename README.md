# Data Science Project

The Jupyter Notebook 'FinalProject.ipynb' in this repository contains code including cleaning of data, visualization of data and the implementation of a logistic regression model to classify data. The notebooks are structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, and include practical implementations, visualizations, and model evaluations. <br> 

The Data-Science-Project folder contains the following files:
- A FinalProject.ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) that contains all the code including text blocks explaining portions of the code
- three .png files that are screenshots of the plots in the Jupyter Notebook
- A BlogPostLinks.pdf file that contains links to two blogposts. The blogposts are published on medium and explain the findings of the project.
- A Presentation.pdf file that summarizes the findings of the project in a presentation format
- A SurveyResponses.csv file that contains the raw data that was collected from people using Google forms.

## Installation Requirements

To run the both the notebooks, you will need the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
 pip install numpy
```
```bash
 pip install pandas
```
```bash
 pip install matplotlib 
```
```bash
 pip install seaborn 
```
```bash
 pip install scikit-learn
```

After installing the libraries, simply run the 'Imports' code block to enable their usage in the file.

## Project Structure

The Jupyter Notebook (KNN.ipynb) is organized into the following sections:
<ul>
<li> Library Imports </li> 
<li> Brief description of the data </li>
<li> Data Cleaning </li>
<li> Dataset Visualization using various graphs </li>
<li> Implementation of a Logistic Regression Machine Learning model along with its evaluation using a classification report </li>   


## Data

The data can be found in the SurveyResponses.csv file.
Here is a description of what each of the columns in the dataset represent:

1. **Timestamp**: The exact timestamp when the respondent submitted the survey.

2. **University**: The name of the university the respondent is enrolled with.

3. **Intended/Current Major**: The respondent's current or intended major field of study.

4. **Plans after degree**: The respondent's plans after completing their degree, such as employment, further education, or self-employment.

5. **Age**: The respondent's age at the time of the survey.

6. **Gender**: The respondent's gender.

7. **Household Monthly Expenses**: The range of the respondent's household monthly expenses, provided as categorical ranges.

8. **Financial Assistance**: Whether the respondent is receiving financial assistance. Values are `Yes`, `No`, or missing if unspecified.

9. **Technical (yes=1, no=0)**: Indicates if the respondent's major is technical (e.g., engineering, computer science). `1` for technical and `0` for non-technical.
